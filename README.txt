The app is developed using React Native, Json Server and Ngrok as database.

There are other items in the `others` folder,
1. jsonserver       - The server code I have used to develop the app.
2. App Explanation  - The explanation of the app.
3. assessment video - The video of me explaining what I have developed.


*Note: 
In order to run this app with the jsonserver I used, run the jsonserver and Ngrok in the command prompt and copy the Forwarding url of Ngrok into the baseURL 'src/api/jsonserver.js'.

Also, I realized sometimes the CartScreen shows empty after refreshing the app even there are items in the cart databaseï¼Œupdating the database (e.g. add product to cart) will make the CartScreen acts normal. I did some research, it seem like a server site problem, please do let me know if the issue is my code problem so I can improve it.
