In this project, I have built an e-commerce app using React Native, I have used Json server and Ngrok as database to store the products added to cart. I have used the data structure as in the project because the structure is what I get from call the outside API fakestoreapi (https://fakestoreapi.com/), thus I choose to maintain the structure. 

The HomeScreen display all products obtain from fakestoreapi regardless category, a filter dropdown list is provided to filter the product, a clear filter button to reset filter is also provided. The CartScreen shows all the products added to cart and their quantity, add and minus the quantity buttons are provided, remove button as well. The screen also shows the total price of the whole cart. Finally, a check out button is there for user to check out the cart, which remove all products from cart and prompt a message of total price checked out.
